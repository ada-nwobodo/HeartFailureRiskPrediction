    "## BACKGROUND & CHALLENGE\n",
    "\n",
    "Approximately 1 million people live with Heart Failure (CCF) in the UK (1), with an estimated 200,000 new diagnoses each year (2). Impacts of late stage diagnosis are felt at the patient level with poorer clinical outcomes (50% mortality at 5 years (3)) as well as at the health system level - additional pressures of managing this condition constitute approximately 2% of total annual NHS budget & 5% of unplanned hospital admissions (4). It is a National Priority and solutions to address it are in line with the NHS Long Term Plan, which emphasises prevention, early diagnosis and integration of digital technologies to improve outcomes and reduce costs as well as with global health priorities. CCF early stage diagnosis rates in the UK remain low with 80% of all diagnoses made in emergency care settings (typically due to progression of undiagnosed disease) despite 40% of patients presenting earlier to primary care settings (5)\n",
    "\n",
    "A barrier to the early diagnosis of this disease is that its main symptoms translate across a number of other differential diagnoses and thus could be mistaken for other disease conditions. There is a documented misdiagnosis rate of 32.5% as a result (6) and these patients often wait years until the correct diagnosis, significantly worsening their outcomes as well as the added costs to the health system to optimise their health. A report by the UK Foundation shows the numbers diagnosed with the disease are expected to increase by 92% by 2040, faster than any other condition including cancers (7)\n",
    "\n",
    "Socio-economic deprivation levels also contribute to an increased risk of late-stage diagnosis, worse outcomes and an increased pressure on the health system. \n",
    "Female patients also twice as likely to be misdiagnosed as male patients in primary care (8)"

    "## THE PROBLEM\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purpose of this project, I defined the problem as a Classification Supervised Machine Learning one for several reasons:- \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The problem involved prediction of a Categorical Outcome (heart failure risk).\n",
    "As such, the goal was to determine whether each individual was at high risk (1) or low risk (0) of heart failure disease. It was thus a binary classification problem (with the target variable being categorical: \"yes\" or \"no\")\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The dataset I used for the project contained labelled data (input features + a target outcome) and thus was amenable for a Supervised Machine learning approach. I had to modify the labels to reflect my project objective for heart failure (as the dataset was originally built for heart disease and not for heart failure)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The features present in the Framingham heart disease dataset included known risk predictors for heart failure which could be used to train my models including :-\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Demographics - age, sex\n",
    "   - Lifestyle factors - smoking\n",
    "   - Pre-existing conditions - prior Coronary Heart Disease (CHD)\n",
    "   - Health Indicators & observations/NEWS score - BMI, cholesterol, blood pressure\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The goal here was **risk prediction** (not time-to-event or other outcomes). The goal was to classify each patient according to their risk levels (as defined within the project), therefore classification techniques including the ones used in this project were appropriate"

    "## DATA COLLECTION \n",
    "\n",
    "Datasets used in this project were obtained from the Kaggle repository (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aasheesh200/framingham-heart-study-dataset/data). This dataset originates from the **Framingham Heart Disease Study (FHS)**, one of the longest-running and most influential cardiovascular research studies in history. It was the first study to establish the following factors as major risk factors for heart disease :- \n",
    "- HBP\n",
    "- High Cholesterol\n",
    "- Smoking\n",
    "- Obesity\n",
    "- Diabetes\n",
    "- Physical inactivity\n",
    "\n",
    "The ongoing study also provided the foundation for the Framingham Risk Score (FRS), used in clinical practice to estimate 10 year CVD risk in patients\n",
    "\n",
    "Features recorded in the datasets include:- \n",
    "1. Male\n",
    "2. Age\n",
    "3. Education\n",
    "4. Current Smoker (Yes/No)\n",
    "5. Cigarettes per day\n",
    "6. BP Meds\n",
    "7. Prevalent Stroke\n",
    "8. Prevalent Hypertension\n",
    "9. Diabetes\n",
    "10. Total Cholesterol\n",
    "11. Systolic BP\n",
    "12. Diastolic BP\n",
    "13. BMI\n",
    "14. Heart Rate\n",
    "15. Glucose (levels)\n",
    "16. Ten Year CHD\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitations of the data included :- \n",
    "1. **Lack of direct Heart Failure outcomes** - as mentioned above, the data was collected to reflect CHD risk and not that of heart failure. Heart failure as a disease condition is distinct from CHD although CHD is a contributory factor. It thus required clinical expertise to modify the given features in order to leverage their data to predict heart failure as an outcome and not CHD\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Limited representation of Heart Failure specific risk factors** - inclusive of\n",
    "       - Ejection fraction (a critical measure of heart function)\n",
    "       - Heart failure symptoms (shortness of breath, bilateral lower limb swelling, fatigue, reduced ETT)\n",
    "       - Kidney function markers (as a correlation between the two exists)\n",
    "       - Medication use (although BP meds were included in the data, it was unclear which ones as only specific BP meds are known to be predictive of heart failiure risk eg ACE-I, b-blockers)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Demographic and Population Bias** - the original cohort was predominantly White, middle class Americans which limits generalisability to diverse populations. The dataset might thus not fully represent ethnic, socioeconomic or geographic variations in heart failure risk\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Lack of Investigation results/reports** - including medical imaging (echocardiography for ejection fraction measurement), BNP blood tests etc. The models built thus had to rely solely on some traditional risk factors\n",
    "\n",
    "All of which meant that the Framingham Heart Disease dataset was useful for my intended objective but not ideal. It required Feature Engineering and label modification as my next effort to improve dataset relevance for Heart Failure modeling"

    "## EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS\n",
    "\n",
    "I undertook this process to better understand the features and their relationships present within selected datasets (deemed of interest for my project objective). Some high level observations made include:- \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Age** - a range between late 30's through to 70 years of age was detected in the dataset Surprisingly the incidence decreased over time (and highest in patients in their late 30's) which likely reflects the age demographics chosen for study follow-up over time\n",
    "2. **BMI** - a boxplot of BMI values suggested a normal distribution of values with the median at 25. Outliers were also noted likely due to data entry errors (although a few likely also due to extreme patient values)\n",
    "3. **BP** - a boxplot of BP distribution showed a slightly right-sided (positive) skew with a median of approximately 130mmHg\n",
    "4. **Sex distribution** - a bar chart plotted with males (represented as 1) showed there were more females than males in the dataset\n",
    "5. **Hypertension** - a separate column for presence/absence of hypertension in the dataset (to that of systolic + diastolic BP columns above) was analysed and showed there were more patients without HBP than those that had the disease present\n",
    "6. **Education** - a bar chart plotted to analyse disparities between education levels showed patient numbers decreased as the education category/level increased. There were 3* as many patient numbers in education level 1 in the dataset as were present in level 4\n"

    "## FEATURE ENGINEERING \n",
    "\n",
    "The target variable present in the Framingham dataset was Ten Year CHD which is related to heart failure (as a risk factor) but not directly. For this project objectives, **I re-defined the target variable to better match heart failure risk as** :- \n",
    "\n",
    " - **High Risk** (1) if the patient has HBP, DM, a smoking history of 5 pack years and above, obesity (high BMI) & prior CVD indicators\n",
    " - **Low Risk** (0) if none or very few of the risk factors were present\n",
    "\n",
    "I next created new Features based on medical knowledge from existing datasets for use in development of the heart failure risk prediction model including :-\n",
    "1. **HBP risk score** - I combined the systolic + diastolic BP values into a categorical BP feature and classified these as\n",
    "           - Normal (<120/80mmHg) -> 0\n",
    "           - Pre-hypertensive (120-139/80-89mmHg) -> 1\n",
    "           - Hypertensive (>140/90mmHg) -> 2\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Obesity indicator** - I converted BMI values into categories\n",
    "           - Normal: BMI <25 -> 0\n",
    "           - Overweight: 25 >= BMI < 30 -> 1\n",
    "           - Obese: BMI >= 30 -> 2\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Heart Stress Index Feature** - I created this new feature which i arbitrarily defined for the purpose of this project objectives as (0.3 * systolic BP + 0.2 * heart rate + 0.3 * smoking + 0.2 * diabetes). This would be used to define the target/outcome variable\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Prior Cardiovascular disease Indicator** - if Ten Year CHD = 1, this is used as prior CVD risk, as it will increase the risk of heart failure (so the original target variable in the Framingham dataset was used instead as one of my input features for my own project objective)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Age Groups** - I converted these into risk categories:-\n",
    "            - <40 years -> Low Risk (0)\n",
    "            - 40 - 60 years -> Moderate Risk (1)\n",
    "            - >60 years -> High Risk (2)\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Total Cholesterol Risk scores** - i grouped total cholesterol values into the following categories :-\n",
    "            - Total Cholesterol <200mg/dL = Low Risk (0)\n",
    "            - Total Cholesterol >200 & <300mg/dL = Moderate Risk (1)\n",
    "            - Total Cholesterol >300mg/dL = High Risk (2)\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Number of Cigarettes smoked/day for cigarette risk scores** :-\n",
    "            - 0 cigarettes smoked/day -> Low Risk (0)\n",
    "            - 1-5 cigarettes smoked/day -> Moderate Risk (1)\n",
    "            - >5 cigaratttes smoked/day -> HIgh risk (2)\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Glucose** - i did not modify these levels as unclear patient states during testing phase (fasting, post-prandial levels,  tested in diabetics or non-diabetic patients etc). Assumptions could have been made however, a separate column already existed for the presence/absence of Diabetes in the dataset so that was used instead\n"

    "## MODEL TRAINING AND DESIGN \n",
    "\n",
    "I built out 2 models (a logistic regression model + an XGBoost model) to classify heart failure risk in each individual present in the dataset as a binary problem :- \n",
    "    - No heart failure risk (0)\n",
    "    - At risk of heart failure (1)\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purpose of this project, I defined heart failure risk as \n",
    "    - High risk if a person had HBP, DM, smoking history of 5 pack years and above, obesity (high BMI) and prior CVD indicators\n",
    "    - Low risk if none or very few risk factors were present\n",
    "\n",
    "**The target of the model predictions was to identify the individuals at a high risk of heart failure for earlier intervention by the health system in order to optimise individual patient outcomes**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The objective being to improve on our current approach to heart failure detection and diagnosis which is not data-driven but entirely reliant on a probabilistic approach to a variety of differential diagnoses for each patient by their clinician**\n",
    "\n",
    "I used the **Supervised Learning technique of Classification** to build models that described the relationship between the feature engineered inputs described in the previous section and the pre-defined target variable described above. The Classification models next predicted which of 2 classes (\"high risk\" or \"low risk\") each individual featured within the entire cohort\n",
    "\n",
    "2 copies of the original dataframe were created (to avoid cross-contamination of outputs from both models) and split into train (80%) and test (20%) subsets for each model\n",
    "\n",
    "#### LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODEL\n",
    "I used the **Logistic Regression model** as a simple, interpretable baseline model to classify each individual as either high or low risk for heart failure disease. It was trained on 80% of the data and predicted on the remaining 20%. A Confusion Matrix was created to compare the predicted classes against actual classes\n",
    "\n",
    "#### XGBOOST MODEL\n",
    "I used an **XGBoost model** as a more advanced model which often outperforms simpler models in medical risk prediction due to its ability to capture non-linear interactions between risk factors in the dataset. It however typically requires large datasets, requires careful tuning and is less explainable, thus explainability methods are often used for interpretation\n"

    "## CONCLUSION \n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of the project was to develop predictive models for identifying individuals at risk of heart failure using the Framingham Heart Disease dataset. Since the dataset was originally designed for coronary heart disease (CHD) prediction, I engineered relevant features and labels to approximate heart failure risk based on known medical risk factors such as HBP, DM, obesity and prior cardiovascular conditions \n",
    "\n",
    "### KEY FINDINGS AND MODEL PERFORMANCE\n",
    "1. Logistic Regression - provided an interpretable baseline model that highlighted key risk factors such as HBP, smoking and diabetes. Achieved a comparable predictive performance (to the XGBoost) with an AUC of 90.58%\n",
    "2. XGBoost - did not outperform the log regression model, with an AUC of 90.26%. This was likely due to the small sample size, the lack of cross validation to ensure balanced data subsets and I did not tune the model hyperparameters\n",
    "\n",
    "### CHALLENGES & LIMITATIONS\n",
    "1. A lack of direct heart failure diagnosis label in the dataset required me to create a proxy target variable which likely introduced some bias\n",
    "2. The datasets used did not include ejection fraction data, clinical symptoms or biomarkers commonly used in diagnosis of heart failure\n",
    "3. Potential class imbalance (eg 2* as many individuals without HBP as those who had HBP) resulting in a few high risk cases would typically require further feature engineering techniques (eg oversampling techniques) to improve the robustness of the models\n",
    "\n",
    "### FUTURE DIRECTIONS\n",
    "To enhance prediction accuracy and clinical relevance, future work should:- \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Integrate real-world Electronic Health Record datasets** that contain verified cases of heart failure\n",
    "2. **Explore deep learning models** for further feature interactions not accessible through supervised learning techniques or obvious to clinician experts\n",
    "3. **Validate the models on external datasets** and apply explainability tools (SHAP, LIME) for clinical interpretability "
